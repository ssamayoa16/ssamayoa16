### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ssamayoa16/ssamayoa16** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an app for my personal usage.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more ways to improve in GitHub, Python intermediate level, and Java Script.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that have ongoing improvements.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with certificates, tutorials, or courses that can help me to develop more skills for my future jobs.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about real estate, how to improve processes, customer service, and Project Management.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: sebsamayoa16@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't like to be steady. I'm always looking for new things to try, and think out of the box.
